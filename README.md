# Software-Extractor

Software to parse and display vital information form Java Source Code. 

Information:
- Classes
- Methods
- Parameters
- Class Heirachies


Your project is to design and implement a computer program that can

read source files containing C++, Java, C# (all pre-approved) or some other object-oriented programming language (must be pre-approved but probably won’t be)

take a “snapshot” the system. Extract and maintain in some type of model information about the classes and methods in the source code

present the extracted model in a reviewable form either in text or graphical user interface


OO-PIES must present at least the following information for version 1:

the name of all classes declared in the source files

the names and types and access delimiter of all data members of the class

the name and types and access delimiter of all methods of the class and return type

class hierarchy, aggregates and association relationships with other classes

for each method, a list of the methods it calls along with the object reference
